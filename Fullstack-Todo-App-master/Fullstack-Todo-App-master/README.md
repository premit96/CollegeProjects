# Fullstack Todo App
### Single Page App TodoList: React Frontend with Node-Express-Mongo backend

[Add your Todo](https://todos-with-react.herokuapp.com/ "Deployed")

*Note: Initial load may take a while because inactive apps hibernate*

Based on the [TodoList API](https://github.com/ioanmeri/todo-api) which is already built 

#### Goal: Focus on the structure of such an App

2 Different Applications:
* React applications run on 1st server for the frontend
* Node API backend running each own server

2 seperate servers talking to another, as well as, the MongoDB server.

**Notes**:

*The API has not been cloned in case of future changes.*

*The website that is provided, although it looks identical to the current app, it's coming from the API.
The same styles has been adapted to React's components.*

*To run the app, the 2 servers must run on different ports.*
